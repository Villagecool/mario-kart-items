# Mario Kart Items Addon
 This is a small addon that adds (almost) every mario kart item to minecraft!
- (Item not included are the mega mushroom and Arcade GP exclusives)

Almost every item is specially coded to have custom physics and behave like they would in a Minecraft setting!
- I had to use trig on this! ðŸ˜±

Currently the project is slightly unfinished and is creative only. This is due to it lacking any form of balance
